# Cleaning messy warehouse data Using Python
In this simple project, I dive deep into cleaning a given data set for a warehouse which needs cleaning. Since cleaning data is crucial in the data analysis process, I have looked at the data and fixed all the errors I 
noticed. 
A summary of the activities done in the process is:
* Dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Removing leading and trailing spaces from string columns.
* Standardised text formats (Procust and Category columns)
* Correcting the data types in various columns to the right types
* Replacing missing values with appropiate defaults/estimates
* Saving the cleaned data in a csv file.
This beng my first prject and also with the urge to grow as a data scientist, I am open to new suggestions regarding what I might have missed.
